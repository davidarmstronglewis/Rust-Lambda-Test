# Rust Lambda Test

### Building

Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to figure out a way to build on my Mac.
Instead I've been building in a Cloud9 environment. Eventually I'd like to figure out how to cross-compile properly on my machine or do the same in a VM or Docker image.

Inside a Cloud9 Environment: `cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
